# TSP-Simulated-Annealing

Finding an optimal solution to Travelling Salesman Problem using Simulated Annealing

# What is Annealing

Annealing is a Materials Science principle (after a while, everything in CS is modelled after some other discipline xD). Basically, it's just a method to increase metal ductility by recrystallising the metal structure by gentle cooling. It all sounds very complicated, but we're not diving into core materials science ideals (if you're interested, tho: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(metallurgy)). The funda is basically the same. We define a temperature parameter which guides how we accept what are strictly speaking "outliers" as per conventional optimisational thinking. More here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing. Scroll down to see some resources to learn simulated annealing.
